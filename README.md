Big Data Analysis on Supply Chain DataCo (Link Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis/data)

Our dataset is from DataCo Global Company, published on Mendeley Data on 13 March 2019, which allows us to explore Supply Chain activities regarding Provisioning, Production, Sales, Commercial Distribution.

DataCo operates its own supply chain for e-commerce customers who buy its products online. After scrutinizing the dataset, we have found out the problem of DataCo Global Company in lead time delivery between Days for shipping (scheduled) versus Days for shipping (real). To investigate more about the cause and consequences, as well as methods to predict and prevent lateness in lead time, we need to perform certain tasks on data analysis and use machine learning/ deep learning algorithms. As delivery lead time is the utmost important factor to recruit and retend customers when competition among e-commerce platform is fierce, moreover, the company have received a lot of negative feedback against its service level. Particularly, the delivery notification has continuously falsely predicted days of delivery.

For example, the system notifies customer of 3 days delivery, but ended up 5 days delivery. Worse than that are cases when customer have paid premium shipping service but still get late delivery.

We are currently employed by DataCo to investigate their problems through purchase history dataset to find patterns making up the delivery lead time and come up with solutions.

We acknowledge the assumption that in each country, the logistics system is operating similar with each other. Therefore, we will consider other features besides logistical operations. We will perform certain tasks on data analysis and implement some machine learning as follow:

1. Step 1: Perform data cleanning
2. Step 2: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Step 3: Feature analysis and selection
4. Step 4: Build models to predict number of lead time days and/or whether orders are on-time delivery.
5. Step 5: Solutions proposals
